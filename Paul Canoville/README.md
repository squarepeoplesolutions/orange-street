Cd to the project folder root and run "gulp"

This will build the html / sass / js files, cpmpress them and start a server at localhost:3000 and open it in your browser 

The php files are in the "verve" folder

Currently you'll need to copy the minified css contents of "/build/style.css" and then paste that in the "verve/style.css" before uploading to the server. Later i'll change this to do it automatically

You can upload the html files to the dev ("/dev/" on the server) first if you want or just make the changes to the php and upload direct

Please start a new branch before pushing any changes to git
