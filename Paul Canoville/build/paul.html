Despite this abuse, and in some cases a noticeable lack of support from within the then regime at the club, Paul built a successful career at the club between 1981-86, winning the Second Division title in 1983-84.</p></div><div class="six columns image-col"><img src=./img/use.jpg></div></div><div class=row><div class="six columns image-col"><img src=./img/IMG_4749.jpg></div><div class="six columns"><h2>Journey</h2><p>Pauls journey, alongside so many other players at clubs across the country at that time, was a hard and in some ways dangerous one. But at Chelsea he paved the way for the next generations of players at a club that has now counted Ruud Gullit, Marcel Desailly, Michael Essien, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Didier Drogba and N’Golo Kante alongside a host of British born black players amongst its ranks of heroes.</p><p>In 1986 Paul moved from Chelsea to <a href="https://www.readingfc.co.uk/">Reading FC</a> but suffered a serious knee injury and was forced to retire in 1987. He continued to be involved in football through the non-league game, but the injury ended his professional career.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="six columns"><h2>Retirement</h2><p>Following his retirement from football at the age of 25, and with little post career planning in place as was usually the case in those times, Paul’s life began to spiral out of control. Despite building a good reputation as a DJ he became involved in, then addicted to crack cocaine, a situation exacerbated by the death of one of his children in 1995 due to a heart defect.</p><p>In 1996 Paul was diagnosed with cancer, specifically Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma – an aggressive form of cancer that attacks the immune system and required chemotherapy and hospitalisation. Despite getting the all clear in 1998, the cancer returned in 2004 and Paul once again needed aggressive treatment to beat the disease.</p><p>In 2005 Paul was given the all clear from cancer, and having beaten the disease for a second time went into rehab, and has been drug free since 2005.</p></div><div class="six columns image-col"><img src=./img/PaulC.jpg></div></div><div class=row><div class="six columns image-col"><img src="./img/Paul c2.jpg"></div><div class="six columns"><h2>Rebuilding</h2><p>Since 2005 Paul has rebuilt his life – writing an award-winning book about his life entitled Black and Blue (published 2007) that was updated as a documentary on Sky Sports in 2015 with contributions from former Chelsea players and supporters, including Pat Nevin, Keith Dublin, Michael Duberry, Eddie Newton and the DJ Trevor Nelson.</p><p>Paul now delivers motivational lectures and workshops on his journey and how he overcame these circumstances for both young people and corporate partners. He has also renewed his working relationship with the new regime at Chelsea, playing for Chelsea Legends (as his knee allows) and acting as a club ambassador on match days and in the community.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="six columns"><h2>Supporter</h2><p>Despite the horrendous treatment he received from sections of the Chelsea support (and indeed within sections of the club) in the early eighties, Paul remains a Chelsea supporter and is immensely popular with the fan base as shown by the standing ovations he receives when introduced to the crowd at matches and events.</p><p>Pauls remarkable life story, and his resilience and strength in overcoming these challenges, has inspired many to approach him for advice. Recognising a need for young people to get advice, guidance, insight and support that was so often missing in his life, Paul established the Foundation to use his story in a positive way to inspire future generations.</p></div><div class="six columns image-col"><img src=./img/IMG_4703.jpg></div></div><div class=row><div class="six columns"><p class=text-center><img src=img/img049.jpg></p></div><div class="six columns"><h2>Setting The Foundation</h2><p>Paul established his Foundation with help from the PFA, supported by the drive of Desmond Edwards to support and educate young people and build their resilience.</p><p>Photo Credit: <a href="http://teds-o-creativeenergy.co.uk/">Ted Smith-Orr</a></p></div></div></section><div><br><br><br><br><hr></div><section class=case-studies><h2 class="text-center fancy">Our Projects</h2><br><br><div class=row><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/IMG_3145.jpg');"><a href=skills-for-life.html><div class=inner><p>Skills for Life</p><button>View project</button></div></a></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/IMG_2511.jpg');"><a href=youth-coaching.html><div class=inner><p>Youth Coaching</p><button>View project</button></div></a></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/IMG_1511.JPG');"><a href=trends.html><div class=inner><p>Trends United</p><button>View project</button></div></a></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/14681568_319185085127086_2932169864330233210_n.jpg');"><a href=helping-homeless.html><div class=inner><p>Helping the homeless</p><button>View Project</button></div></a></div></div></section><section><br><hr><br></section><footer><div class=container><a href=https://www.facebook.com/paul.canoville target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/facebook.png');"></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/CanovilleFdn target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/twitter.png');"></a> <a href=javascript:void(0); class=social style="background-image: url('img/linkedin.png');"></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=paul+canoville" target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/youtube.png');"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kingcanners/" target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/instagram.png');"></a></div><div class=container><p class=copyright>&copy; Copyright Paul Canoville Foundation 2017</p></div></footer></body></html>
