I wanted to create an evening where the general public could get up close and personal with some of their former heroes and heroines, to hear first-hand stories about their struggles within the context of a live audience. Although we’ve come a long way, it’s still worthwhile to look back to understand exactly how far we’ve come, as well as look forward and seek out ways to make continued progress.</p><p><strong>Cllr Sue Fennimore</strong>, Deputy Leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council, said:</p><p>"We were delighted to host the Paul Canoville Foundation's event for Black History Month, which highlighted the challenges faced by black footballers, and celebrated their achievements in the game. Hammersmith & Fulham is proud to be home to three top football clubs, and the stories we heard from pioneers of the game both local, and national, showed both how much can be done in times of adversity, and how much we can still do to achieve true equality of opportunity for all. I'd like to thank Paul, and all who participated in the Football Firsts event, for an evening that was as emotionally affecting, as it was educational."</p><p>The Paul Canoville Foundation would like to thank all the panel, attendees, and our supporters at Hammersmith and Fulham Council, the Professional Footballers Association, Kick It Out and the Football Association without whom the event could not have happened.</p><br></div></section><section class="case-studies grey-panel"><h2 class="section-title text-center">News &amp; events</h2><div class=row><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/rocket-launch-67643_1280.jpg');"><a href=foundation-relaunch.html><div class=inner><p>foundation Relaunch</p><button>View more</button></div></a></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/FullSizeRender.jpg');"><a href=golf-day.html><div class=inner><p>Dallas Golf Day</p><button>View more</button></div></a></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/IMG_0485-e1468673102201.jpg');"><a href=ukraine-visit.html><div class=inner><p>Ukraine Visit</p><button>View more</button></div></a></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url('img/14681568_319185085127086_2932169864330233210_n.jpg');"><a href=homeless-news-post.html><div class=inner><p>Helping the Homeless</p><button>View more</button></div></a></div></div></section><section><br><hr><br></section><footer><div class=container><a href=https://www.facebook.com/paul.canoville target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/facebook.png');"></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/CanovilleFdn target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/twitter.png');"></a> <a href=javascript:void(0); class=social style="background-image: url('img/linkedin.png');"></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=paul+canoville" target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/youtube.png');"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kingcanners/" target=_blank class=social style="background-image: url('img/instagram.png');"></a></div><div class=container><p class=copyright>&copy; Copyright Paul Canoville Foundation 2017</p></div></footer></body></html>
