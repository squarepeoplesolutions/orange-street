                 <p>The 'Get Up, Get Moving' programme was a one week cross-curricular education programme of lectures designed to increase awareness of physical activity, healthy eating and consequences of inactivity and poor lifestyles such as obesity and associated diseases. The programme was been developed specifically for the ZRF by educational and health professionals including Doctor Zafar Iqbal who lectures in Sports and Exercise Medicine and was the first team doctor at Liverpool Football Club.</p>

                <p>The programme involved five one-hour lectures - which is how much physical activity children should be doing per day. School teaching staff were armed with all the relevant materials to deliver the programme and supported with a workshop delivered by medical professionals who work within the football and sports industry. By delivering the key messages through individuals linked with professional football clubs and inspirational role models such as Steven Gerrard MBE, Zesh Rehman and Dr Zafar Iqbal, we hoped that children would take more interest, enhance their knowledge and increase their activity levels to develop healthier communities.</p>

                <p>Following successful pilots in Liverpool, the ZRF was pleased to announce Liverpool FC and England Captain Steven Gerrard MBE as the National Ambassador for the 'Get Up, Get Moving' programme.</p>

                <p>"The impact which footballers and clubs can have on the life choices of young people is evident from the successful projects which have been delivered by the Zesh Rehman Foundation. I am sure the continual development and delivery of the project will benefit the people from the city of Liverpool and many more communities across the country" Steven Gerrard MBE.</p>
