                <h2>Another Great Charity Day with ICAP</h2>
                <!-- <p class="meta">JULY 6, 2017 LONDON, YOUNG-PEOPLE</p> -->
                <p>Our Founder Rio and the Foundation team were super pleased to be welcomed to back to ICAP again this year for their Charity Trading Day 2017. Last year was our first year at the fundraiser and this year saw another star-studded line up of celebs who were all there donating their time to support their chosen causes. As always, the traders were full of enthusiasm for the causes they were supporting and of course for the celebs they were rubbing shoulders and closing deals with.  </p>

                <p>Every year, ICAP’s staff, customers and suppliers get behind their Charity Day and give away all their revenues and commissions to benefit the lives of thousands of people through the nominated charities involved. RFF were ecstatic to be invited back again this year. Our Strategic Director Gary Stannett who joined Rio at the event said:</p>

                <blockquote>“We had a great day at ICAP this year and Rio did us proud again – he’s getting pretty good at closing deals now! All the staff at ICAP were brilliant and clearly enjoyed the day and supporting a host of amazing causes which was good to see. Massive thanks to ICAP for having us and we look forward to more exciting Charity Day’s with you in future!”</blockquote>

                <p>Since ICAP started their Charity Day over 20 years ago they’ve raised a fantastic £135 million – the Rio Ferdinand Foundation feel privileged to be involved.</p>
