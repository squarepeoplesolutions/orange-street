                <h2>Young People from Salford Complete a L1 Developing Community Activities for Youth At Risk!</h2>
                <p class="meta">JANUARY 25, 2017 NEWS,Â SALFORD</p>
                <p>The Rio Ferdinand Foundation partnered up with Active Communities Network to deliver a free accredited qualification: Level 1 Developing Community Activities for Youth at Risk. 16 young people from Salford aged 14/15 learnt new skills and knowledge in order to successfully plan, deliver and evaluate community sports activities.</p>
                <p>Learners received training on how to mentor high risk young people, challenge attitudes/behaviour, health and safety, partnership working and the importance of being a positive role model!!! Learners took part in various activities and tasks in order to complete the 2 day qualification at UTC Media City UK.</p>
                <p>Group tasks and presentations helped to build confidence, participant Teagan quotes &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed the course, it was interesting to not only learn about leading sports activities but also how to mentor and understand working with young people who may have various needs and issues, I want to coach football as a volunteer for the Rio Ferdinand Foundation so this course has been incredibly helpful in terms of building my confidence&rdquo;.</p>
                <p>Now that the 2 days have been completed all learners will volunteer within a local community based sports project, helping RFF&rsquo;s key partners to deliver activities for disadvantaged young people in Manchester during the February half-term.</p>
                <p>This work placement opportunity helps give our learners essential work experience and transferable skills, everyone will receive a working reference and certificate upon completion!</p>
                <p>RFF would like to thank our partners at Active Communities Network, UTC Media City and funders Tony Lloyd Police and Crime Commissioner.</p>
