This three-year grant will build on our previous &lsquo;Rio&rsquo;s Rising Stars&rsquo; programme working across Salford and will now see us expand into Hulme and Moss Side. Our hugely successful Rising Stars programme reached thousands of young people and was independently evaluated by the University of Gloucestershire as an &ldquo;extremely effective intervention methodology for creating positive outcomes for at-risk youth&rdquo;. The Youth Leaders programme follows this model in creating structured development pathways for young people to develop them as leaders in their communities. In doing so, we help to tackle issues of youth crime and anti-social behaviour, along with youth unemployment and academic underachievement by creating opportunities for local young people and raising their aspirations to achieve.</p><p>In addition to Big Lottery Foundation, the programme has support from across the statutory sector as well as a plethora of corporate and charity partners including many of Media City&rsquo;s cutting-edge media companies.</p><p><strong>Our Patron Rio Ferdinand said:</strong></p><blockquote>&ldquo;Fantastic to be working with Big Lottery again in Manchester and to see that our work in Salford can now be extended to work with other young people in the city. From our experience over last three years there&rsquo;s a great amount of talented and motivated young people in the city who need support and pathways to achieve and this funding gives us a fantastic opportunity to do that.&rdquo;</blockquote><p><strong>Victoria Lowe, Manager of the RFF Programmes in Salford said:</strong></p><blockquote>&ldquo;We are incredibly excited to continue our work in Salford and expand into new areas within Manchester, our aim through this grant is to support more local young people by providing positive youth-led initiatives. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to working alongside local partners and organisations to ensure programme quality and innovation. We are extremely grateful to the Big Lottery and all the team based there that supported RFF.&rdquo;</blockquote><br></div></section><div class=social><a href=https://www.facebook.com/RioFoundation><img src=./img/facebook_logo.png></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/riofoundation><img src=./img/twitter_logo.png></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rioferdinandfoundation/"><img src=./img/instagram_logo.png></a> <a href=https://www.snapchat.com/add/riofoundation><img src=./img/snapchat_logo.png></a></div><div class=indent-bottom><div class=container><hr></div></div><footer>&copy; Copyright Rio Ferdinand Foundation</footer></body></html>
