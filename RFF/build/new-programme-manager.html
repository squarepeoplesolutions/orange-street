Learning about how people interact with the world around them, why it is like it is and how it possibly could be in the future, attracted Anna to the idea of community work in order to help create positive opportunities for young people.</p><p>Anna has an interest in digital media, and radio in particular, so got involved with local community radio station, Reform Radio when she arrived in Manchester last autumn. Through this she completed a creative, digital media course that was part of the Manchester Adult Education Services, aimed at getting young people the skills and confidence to get them into work that involved producing a live radio show. Anna has since been a regular volunteer at Reform Radio, helping with the day to day running of the studio which included tasks such as studio management, editing content and creating artwork, along with producing strategic content used for marketing the shows on the station, in particular on social media. However, her interest in youth work meant she naturally gravitated towards the community aspects of the radio station, which meant helping to assist the running of the youth programmes. This involved helping to deliver workshops that made up the Salford City College Traineeship and the Manchester Adult Education Service Programme. This was the very same course she attended, meaning that she gained an insight into the importance of non-tradition learning such as the Rio Ferdinand Foundation offers, as she herself has recently been on both the receiving and delivering side of a participatory project.</p><p>Anna has also been a part of a project with the Welcome Trust in which she worked to create a piece of engaging short form media in the form of a series of podcasts, aimed at engaging young people aged 16-25 in science, making it more relatable and relevant to everyday life. She also enjoyed completing a two-day course at Contact Theatre called Future Fires about the delivering socially engaging projects and gained skills such as devising project ideas, project management, creating budgets and fundraising. Subsequently Anna has been attending a plethora of specialised workshops from topics as wide as documentary film making on iPhones, sound engineering, furniture making to mental health awareness; all to increase her knowledge and understanding of issues surrounding both youth work and digital media (and to have fun of course). Alongside this Anna also worked part time as a marketing assistant at a Manchester based drinks company and behind the bar at the arts centre HOMEmcr.</p><p>For Anna, this role at RFF seemed like the perfect next step and she cannot wait to bring her creative, digital media skills and abundance of energy to the team to help engage with young people and develop ground breaking creative, digital media, sports and arts projects!!!</p><p>Welcome to the team Anna!!!</p><br></div></section><section class=gallery><div class=container><img src=./img/IMG_2604-1024x692.jpg></div></section><div class=social><a href=https://www.facebook.com/RioFoundation><img src=./img/facebook_logo.png></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/riofoundation><img src=./img/twitter_logo.png></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rioferdinandfoundation/"><img src=./img/instagram_logo.png></a> <a href=https://www.snapchat.com/add/riofoundation><img src=./img/snapchat_logo.png></a></div><div class=indent-bottom><div class=container><hr></div></div><footer>&copy; Copyright Rio Ferdinand Foundation</footer><div class=popup><button class=close-popup>X</button><div class=popup-inner><img></div></div></body></html>
