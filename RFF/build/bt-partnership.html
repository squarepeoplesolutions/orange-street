Our foundation aims to provide mentoring and employment pathways to help young people in economically deprived communities.</p><p>With the support of BT, and Active Communities Network we will be providing mentoring and teaching skills for employment to help young people from deprived communities. Initially, the activity will be focused in Belfast, then we will introduce it more widely across Northern Ireland in the future.</p><p>With the world of work getting more competitive, we want to ensure as many young people as possible have the sufficient confidence, knowledge and vital skills for work, that they will need to get a job.</p><p>BT currently offers a range of pre-employment opportunities through the BT Work Ready programme including traineeships, work placements, and skills-for-work boot camps. The programme is designed to help 14-24-year-olds build confidence and get the essential skills and work experience they need to get a job.</p><p>Rio Ferdinand, said:</p><blockquote>“I’m really excited to be striking-up this partnership with BT and at the prospect of working with the Active Communities Network to help youngsters gain the skills and confidence they need to succeed in the world of work. I am particularly pleased that we can now offer these opportunities in Belfast following the fantastic support my Foundation has received from that city in the past.”</blockquote><p>Jim Donnelly, Head of Programmes NI for Active Communities Network said:</p><blockquote>“This is an exciting new partnership that will bring a real energy into creating employment opportunities for our tremendous young people in Belfast and we are delighted to be involved.”</blockquote><p>For more information on the BT Work Ready programme visit: <a href=http://www.bt.com/workready>www.bt.com/workready</a></p><p>For more information on the Active Communities Network visit: <a href=http://www.activecommunities.org.uk>http://www.activecommunities.org.uk</a></p><br></div></section><section class=gallery><div class=container><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/ActiveCommunitiesRioFoundationJC226.jpg);"></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/ActiveCommunitiesRioFoundationJC215.jpg);"></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/ActiveCommunitiesRioFoundationJC218.jpg);"></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/ActiveCommunitiesRioFoundationJC222.jpg);"></div></div></section><div class=social><a href=https://www.facebook.com/RioFoundation><img src=./img/facebook_logo.png></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/riofoundation><img src=./img/twitter_logo.png></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rioferdinandfoundation/"><img src=./img/instagram_logo.png></a> <a href=https://www.snapchat.com/add/riofoundation><img src=./img/snapchat_logo.png></a></div><div class=indent-bottom><div class=container><hr></div></div><footer>&copy; Copyright Rio Ferdinand Foundation</footer><div class=popup><button class=close-popup>X</button><div class=popup-inner><img></div></div></body></html>
