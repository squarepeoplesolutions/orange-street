The RFF team and our wonderful volunteers worked in partnership with Walkden High School to help promote the involvement of girls into sports.</p><p>With thanks to our funders at Sport England we were able to present the winners and runners up with some brilliant prizes and signed Rio t-shirts from our founder! Our winners St Ambrose Barlow celebrated in style with our runners up from Walkden High School.</p><p>We were incredibly impressed by the level of team work, respect and passion for the game. RFF would like to thank Walkden PE teacher Mandy Bawden for all her time and support with this event.</p><p>RFF have been working with a cohort of girls from UTC for the past 6 months delivering an all-girls football programme involving football training sessions, mentoring, accredited qualifications and a work placement coaching multi sports. The girls entered a team into their first tournament and played incredibly well against others that are more established.</p><p>The girls will be going on to a work placement opportunity coaching in a local primary school for the next 4 weeks and are very excited to showcase their new skills on and off the pitch!</p><p>RFF would also like to thank our brilliant photographer Tom Woodhead, our fixtures coordinators Ryan Bish and Gary Thomas and all the team managers that came down to support the girls.</p><br></div></section><section class=gallery><div class=container><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/18309029_10212979524587616_1008725660_n.jpg);"></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/18308982_10212979524547615_230572056_n.jpg);"></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/18308853_10212979524947625_1344593098_n.jpg);"></div><div class="three columns" style="background-image: url(./img/18302089_10212979524507614_1314970318_n.jpg);"></div></div></section><div class=social><a href=https://www.facebook.com/RioFoundation><img src=./img/facebook_logo.png></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/riofoundation><img src=./img/twitter_logo.png></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rioferdinandfoundation/"><img src=./img/instagram_logo.png></a> <a href=https://www.snapchat.com/add/riofoundation><img src=./img/snapchat_logo.png></a></div><div class=indent-bottom><div class=container><hr></div></div><footer>&copy; Copyright Rio Ferdinand Foundation</footer><div class=popup><button class=close-popup>X</button><div class=popup-inner><img></div></div></body></html>
