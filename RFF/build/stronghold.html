It provides support and a networking community for small business owners.</p><p>RFF Manchester was there to explain how putting passionate volunteers into your organisation can help to make your business more successful.</p><p>Sometimes the idea of approaching a business and looking for work experience can be quite a daunting experience for a young person, so RFF acts like a bridge to help young people form a relationship with local employers and give that all important support to make sure both the young person and the employer can get the most out of the experience.</p><p>This is done by co-designing a personal development plan in which we set expectations, monitor their progress and form case studies.</p><p>It’s all about being able to give young people a taste of what the working world is like! To help them make more informed decisions going forward, whilst also bring benefits to a business such as motivating and empowering employees, developing skills and attracting the right kind of work force!</p><p>There are many different forms a business partnership can take, some examples include getting young people to support an area of a business that they are a natural expert in such as social media or it could be a day of skill swapping in which employees come and volunteer for RFF!!! Another way a business can help is by sponsoring a young person through our Youth Leaders programme, which enables a young person aged 14-25 to design, fundraise and deliver their own social action project that enhances skills from managing to budgeting</p><p>Alternatively being able to offer a professional 1-2-1 mentoring session to support one of our young people to set up their own business would be fantastic</p><p>If you are reading this and think it could be something for you, please don’t hesitate to get in touch via telephone +44 (0) 7375701950 or by emailing anna@rioferdinandfoundation.com</p><p>RFFManchester would like to thank BNI Bury Stronghold, and in particular Siaed from Therapy First for giving us this opportunity.</p><br></div></section><section class=gallery><div class=container><p class=text-center><img src=./img/DSC_4956.jpg></p></div></section><div class=social><a href=https://www.facebook.com/RioFoundation><img src=./img/facebook_logo.png></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/riofoundation><img src=./img/twitter_logo.png></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rioferdinandfoundation/"><img src=./img/instagram_logo.png></a> <a href=https://www.snapchat.com/add/riofoundation><img src=./img/snapchat_logo.png></a></div><div class=indent-bottom><div class=container><hr></div></div><footer>&copy; Copyright Rio Ferdinand Foundation</footer><div class=popup><button class=close-popup>X</button><div class=popup-inner><img></div></div></body></html>
