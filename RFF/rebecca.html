                <h2>#RFFManchester catches up with community role model Rebecca.</h2>
                <!-- <p class="meta">JULY 6, 2017 LONDON, YOUNG-PEOPLE</p> -->
                <p>Rebecca is 19 years old and is from Walkden in Salford. Rebecca is interested in youth work and her journey with RFFManchester has lead her to be on both the staff and participant sides of the programmes we run</p>

 <p>She first came into contact with the Rio Ferdinand Foundation at the beginning of 2017. She was volunteering at Bridgewater Youth Centre in Little Hulton when she saw that RFF looking for some staff to help out on projects. seizing this experience, she applied and got it</p>

<p>Her first role was helping out with our boxing project, where she got to see young people’s from her own community’s confidence grow for 8 weeks alongside college. She was so good we had her back to help run the biking project we ran in Walkden Shopping Centre. Here we turned empty space in the centre into a bike track where positive, fun activities could happen where normally young people are not allowed. Rebecca then joined us in gaining her FA coaching level one qualification, in which she set up her own volunteering opportunity, helping out with the UCAN Football team every Saturday, which then helped her to land a summer job with Salford Community Leisure!! More recently Rebecca came back to support the running of our Employability programme with Hideaway Youth Project and Intu Trafford Centre, helping young people from Salford and Moss side gain qualifications and experience.</p>

<p>Rebecca has been extremely proactive in Youth work at a remarkably young age, its been her main interest for the last few years and she has built up a rather impressive resume. She went down this pathway due to the difference her youth worker made to her life. She used to be really shy as a child although you could never tell now!! Getting involved has improved her confidence and helped with past mental health issues. Being proactive in her community brings Rebecca immense amounts of happiness as she can spread the same life changing opportunities that were given to her. </p>

<p>Her passion has meant that she knows for certain that she wants to work with children in the future, which is a change from her previous years of switching from college, to an apprenticeship, then back to college as she found it difficult to find exactly what it was she wanted to do. It’s also meant that her part time job whilst at college has not been a dead end job like many of her friends as she is paid to do something she loves.</p>

<p>Going forward Rebecca has one more year left in college, then is hopefully off to university to study childhood and youth studies. Longer term she would love to work for an organisation such as RFF or Salford Community Leisure and continue to be active in her community and a positive role model</p>


<p>Here at RFFManchester we absolutely love working with Rebecca, her energy is infectious and she brings enthusiasm and laughter to anything she does. We wish her all the best for the future!</p>

<p>RFF would like to thank our funders at the Big Lottery for being able to support Rebecca and provide amazing opportunities for other young people from Salford, Moss Side and Hulme.</p>
